shell scripting

basically its a text-code of bash commands joint together in a file, which is executable by bash

infos in wiki

every script begins with #!/bin/bash
	- tells os, which language to use -> bash


vars created per assignment: var = "smthsmth"
and adressed by $: $var

vars are NOT saved .... duh -.- but you can export it with: export var
	exported vars 	are assumed to have their value in each script
			are resetted after session

arrays: array = (smth smth smth)
	echo ${array[*]}
	extendable by: array += (smth smth smth)

calc can be done by $((...))
	usable with vars: x=2; y=$((x+3))

If loops

if [ statement ]; then
	commands
fi
	-> exact syntax is important, even spaces!

WTF is it good for?
- Makros /alias
- grabbing shell output
	-> automatizing more complex processes (calling seeral scripts, using vars)
- makefiles
	-> better than make.sh, cause more functionality (can clean, create documentary)
	-  seems to be complicated, but useful for installing / compiling
	-  kinda complicated, but useful for bigger projects
	-  compiling latex thesis with makefile
	-  cmakes can create makefiles / übermakefile - both for linux and windows
	-  made by gnu, documentation is good
